mkRPG is a jMonkeyEngine based 3D MMORPG engine which externalizes RPG elements such as characters, jobs, skills, props and weapons in XML files.  In this way, game designers/developers can focus on the game logic instead of programming and easily implement their 3D MMORPG games by configuring XML files.

The client side of mkRPG is based on jMonkeyEngine(for 3D rendering, input, audio) and the server side on JGN or Darkstar.

Currently the mkRPG is still under heavy design and development focusing on the main framework, and source code would be updated when the design of the architecture becomes more stable.
